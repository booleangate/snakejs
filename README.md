Snake
=======

A clone of the classic Snake video game. 

## Demo
https://snake-js.herokuapp.com/

## Install

To run this locally, first do an npm install

    npm install

## Running locally

Then run it

    npm run
    
This will launch a standalone server and make the app available at http://localhost:5000/

### Testing
I haven't found a good way to run unit tests with RequireJS modules from the command line yet.  In lieu of that, test can be found and ran at http://localhost:5000/
